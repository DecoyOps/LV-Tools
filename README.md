# LV Tools for Houdini

## Version 1.0.0

# PLEASE NOTE:

If you had this installed before, its worth redownloading and fixing the install directory as I made some changes to the structure of the git repo.
If you are a git user, its worth it to clear the folder and backup any preferences you need, and then reclone it.
